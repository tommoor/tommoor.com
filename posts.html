more regular blog cadence and record some of the thinking and process behind building [Outline](https://www.getoutline.com?ref=tommoor) (and hopefully other products!).\n\nBecause the [source code](https://www.github.com/outline/outline) of Outline is public and is one of only a few large Node applications with a fully open codebase I’m hoping it can allow for a unique lens into product development and engineering decisions that isn’t often shared!\n\nOne of the reasons I haven't posted in the last few years was the difficulty in doing so, the old site\nwas using Jekyll and the hassle of remembering how to publish was just enough friction to prevent it happening… So, in an effort to remove this hurdle I cloned the [outline-website](https://github.com/outline/website) repository, tore it apart, added in all the old markdown posts and ta-da – new site running on Next.js!"},{"title":"You Should Open Source Your Product","slug":"2019/01/02/you-should-open-source-your-product","date":"2019-01-02T05:00:00.000Z","tag":"","content":"\nFrom the start, we knew we wanted to open source our team knowledge base, [Outline](https://getoutline.com). One of the main reasons it exists is because several startups in the space had shut down and we felt that the need remained. During this past year of open development, many other benefits of open sourcing a product have become increasingly clear – both through my own experiences and talking with founders of other companies.\n\n\n## Peace of mind\n\nIn this age of low cost of entry and abundant startups, products are more likely to disappear after a couple of years than succeed. One of the biggest reasons potential customers will never even try your product is the reluctance to invest time and data into something that might not be around tomorrow.\n\nOpen source provides some peace of mind – if for whatever reason the product becomes unmaintained then the community can fork the source code (see [The Storybook Story](https://medium.com/storybookjs/the-storybook-story-dd3c1ab0d2ce) for a great example), run their own version in-house, or more easily build tooling to export data in a worst-case scenario.\n\n\n## Market positioning\n\nA couple of years ago It felt like [GitLab](http://gitlab.com) became a realistic contender for git hosting seemingly overnight. While it has since come a long way, the first version of the product was almost a direct clone of GitHub. \n\nOne of the core reasons that developers flocked to the platform despite this was the [open core nature of the project](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/07/20/gitlab-is-open-core-github-is-closed-source/). For developer tools and platforms, in particular, simply embodying the philosophies of OSS can be enough to differentiate a new product from the crowd.\n\n\n## Customer acquisition\n\nOpen source could be thought of as a subset of content marketing – every commit, pull request, and issue is public content indexed and often keyword-rich. It provides a number of channels for new customer acquisition – the code repositories themselves of course, but also the ecosystem of publications, websites, listicles, and newsletters that cover OSS development.\n\n[Sentry](http://sentry.io), an open source error tracking service, was a project for several years before it spun out into an actual company – today around ~65% of their inbound referral traffic is still from their source code repositories, hosted on GitHub.\n\n\n## Best practices \u0026 documentation\n\nBuilding in public is a uniquely satisfying experience. Personally, I often find myself performing to a higher standard when I know that all the work I produce is publicly visible. Defaulting to more judicious comments, ensuring full test coverage, and putting extra effort into being a clear communicator.\n\nIf you can't go all-in, consider open sourcing components and individual libraries. Once a high-level concept is abstracted and decoupled from the specifics of a codebase it often becomes both easier to reason about and will inevitably lead to better defined API's and public interfaces.\n\n\n## Community \u0026 contributors\n\nAt the time of writing, [Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org), an open source background processing implementation for Ruby, has more than [380 individual contributors](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/graphs/contributors) to its repository on GitHub. These people have fixed bugs, filed issues, written documentation, contributed to feature discussions, and generally done the types of things you’d pay a six-figure salary for in the bay area!\n\nAlthough Sidekiq does offer commercial licenses (and makes a [nice profit doing so](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/016-mike-perham-of-sidekiq)) this doesn’t stop community members from donating their time and skills to help improve the software for everyone.\n\n\n## Hiring pipeline\n\nWordpress ([famously?](https://hbr.org/2014/04/the-ceo-of-automattic-on-holding-auditions-to-build-a-strong-team)) replaced white-boarding exercises and code challenges with a “try out” period as part of their hiring process, paying candidates to undertake issues in their actual codebase. This is made possible because the code is public, for a closed source team it would generally be out of the question to provide access to the codebase before a hiring decision is made.\n\nWhile using open source contributions in a general sense as a hiring decision maker is generally considered problematic – *specific* experience with your product’s codebase is an ideal way to gauge both a potential hires technical and communication skills in a realistic way.\n\n\n## Free tools \u0026 services\n\nAt the beginning of a project, every dollar matters and spending hundreds on infrastructure before the product is making any money is a difficult hurdle for many to overcome. Luckily, lots of tools have free or heavily discounted plans for OSS projects as a way of giving back – whether it’s CI, server hosting, error tracking, or mailing lists.\n\nThis is a great list that covers many freebies: [opensource candies](https://github.com/velikanov/opensource-candies).\n\n\n## But it’s not all roses…\n\nSo at this point, you’re probably ready to hit the big red button and publish all your code… right?! While you’ll find that many things are improved with an open codebase it’s important to note that there are some downsides to take into consideration…\n\n#### Licenses and agreements\nIt’s a good idea to make sure that outside contributors sign agreements such as a [CLA](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/cla) before their code is merged into the project. In the event of a future acquisition or change of ownership you’ll thank your past self.\n\n#### Competitors get insight into feature development and roadmap\nI believe that for most startup companies today this is a non-issue, founders tend to be overly protective of their ideas and roadmap when in reality they’d be better off getting this information in front of potential users as soon as possible.\n\nBut of course, some ideas have a wider moat than others and this insight into your companies plans might be something you need to avoid.\n\n#### No security through obscurity\nOpen source software is generally considered more secure in the long term – more eyes on an application’s code can help identify and fix security holes. However, opening up your code to scrutiny also provides would-be attackers with direct insight into potential loopholes and security problems. \n\nIt also means that even more care has to be taken than usual for sins like accidentally committing API keys into git or adding customer details into public issues.\n\n#### Increased overhead of documentation\nIt’s even more important when code is public that documentation is thorough, clear, and makes as few assumptions of the reader as possible. Writing this level of documentation takes a lot of time and effort that in the early stages of a product might be time better spent on core business problems.\n\n#### Community maintenance\nSimilarly, a vibrant open source community doesn’t come for free. Issues need to be triaged, questions answered, and pull requests reviewed. If the issues and unfinished branches begin to pile up then this is an immediate warning flag to users and those considering contributing.\n\nAs well, the more popular your open source project becomes the more work there is to do shepherding and maintaining the community – popularity may be a curse that only larger teams can manage…\n\n\n**If you've had great success or failure making your companies code public I'd love to hear about it in the comments.**"},{"title":"Reclaim Your Privacy","slug":"2017/01/02/getting-your-privacy-back","date":"2017-01-08T05:00:00.000Z","tag":"","content":"\nIn 2017 it’s incredibly hard to use the internet without constantly giving away your personal information… it’s absolutely the norm for a single website you visit to send personally identifying information to your ISP, the website itself, their advertisers, multiple tracking and analytics companies, plus all the social networks you’re logged into.\n\nI don’t think you have to be paranoid, taking part in nefarious activities or a privacy obsessive to not want this to be the case! To me it seems like common sense that you would reduce the amount of personal information you leave lying around on companies servers in the same way it’s common sense not to leave your bank details lying on the street.\n\nThankfully with just a little effort you can make a huge difference without having to jump through lots of hoops every time you use the internet!\n\n\n## Install an AdBlocker\nYou’re probably already using an AdBlocker, according to [ClarityRay](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-percentage-of-Internet-users-that-employ-AdBlock-Plus-or-similar-ad-blocking-plugins) on average around 10% of visits to websites use an AdBlocker of some description.\n\nBy blocking adverts you reduce visual clutter, increase page load times and limit the amount of information about your browsing habits gathered by third parties. I recommend [UBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) for the lightest footprint.\n\nSince installing on my machine it has blocked 7% of outgoing connections - almost 1 million requests.\n\nWhilst you’re at it don’t forget about your mobile browser. For iOS [‘Focus’ by Firefox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/firefox-focus-privacy-browser/id1055677337?mt=8) is the way to go, ensure you enable the integration with Safari to get all it's benefits.\n\n\n## Ensure HTTPS\nThe [HTTP Everywhere extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp/related) from the EFF makes sure that you always connect to the secure version of web services if available - this prevents your ISP and other middlemen from inspecting and potentially injecting content into webpages you load (Yep, [they](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/09/why-comcasts-javascript-ad-injections-threaten-security-net-neutrality/) [do](http://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/12/canadian-isp-tests-injecting-content-into-web-pages/) [this](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2925839/net-neutrality/code-injection-new-low-isps.html)).\n\n\n## Change Your Default Search Engine\nGoogle is great and the results are obviously top notch - however their data collection policies are really awful. I find for 99% of searches [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) does just as good a job and doesn’t track your activity against an extensive personal profile like Google will.\n\nDuckDuckGo makes a great default search engine that is visually very similar to Google, you can find [quick install instructions here](https://duckduckgo.com/install).\n\n\n## Chrome Privacy Settings\nUsing Chrome? Next up lets customize the privacy and content settings to be a little more picky about the data we give away. First off you’ll want to block third party cookies, navigate to: [Chrome Content Settings](chrome://settings/content)\n\nCheck “Block third party cookies and site data”. This helps to prevent trackers that may slip through UBlock from tracking you across websites.\n\nNext head to [Chrome Settings](chrome://settings), scroll to the bottom and click the tiny text that says “Show advanced settings…”, scroll again to Privacy (Phew, it’s almost like they don’t want you to find this!). I would recommend unticking the majority of these settings apart from Send a “Do Not Track” request with your browsing traffic which should be ticked and probably isn't.\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/chrome-privacy.png\" alt=\"Chrome Privacy\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n￼\n\n## Google Privacy Settings\nThe big G provides a [single dashboard for managing activity](https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols) that they track and save. Personally I have everything here disabled (paused) apart from ‘Device Information’ which keeps your apps and settings synced across devices. By default Google will be tracking your location, search history and every webpage you visit if you’re using Chrome - eesh.\n\n\n## Facebook Privacy Settings\nMost of us have a Facebook account even if it doesn’t get used too much. At this point we’ve blocked Facebook’s trackers on other websites, told them not to track us and ensured we’re always viewing Facebook over HTTPS but there’s definitely more to do! By default Facebook’s advertising policies are quite… invasive, lets turn them down a bit by visiting the [Facebook Privacy Settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads)\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/facebook-privacy.png\" alt=\"Chrome Privacy\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nTurn everything on that page to “No”. Next hit up the [timeline option](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=timeline\u0026view) and consider turning off photo tagging suggestions at the bottom of this page.\n\nThis is also a good opportunity to double check which apps you’ve authorized to read your Facebook information and remove any you no longer want to have access, the full list of [apps with access to Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications).\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/facebook-apps.png\" alt=\"Chrome Privacy\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nAt the bottom there is also an “Apps Others Use” section, click edit and untick everything in there which gives permission for your friends to share your data. It won’t have any effect on your personal Facebook experience as far as I can tell.\n\n\n## Twitter Privacy Settings\nWe’re getting somewhere, don’t give up yet! Next up is Twitter - similar to Facebook you’ll want to turn off all the advertisement tailoring and maybe the default location tagging depending on your preference on the [Twitter settings](https://twitter.com/settings/security) (Don’t forget to hit ‘Save Changes’ at the bottom of the page)\n\nYou might have accidentally uploaded your entire address book to Twitter (they make this way too easy) - double check if that’s the case here and consider deleting the data on the [Twitter contacts dashboard](https://twitter.com/settings/contacts_dashboard).\n\nThis is also a good opportunity to double check which apps you’ve authorized to read your Twitter information and remove any you no longer want to have access, here is the full list of [apps with access to Twitter](https://twitter.com/settings/applications).\n\n\n## Install a Password Manager\nIf you’re still using a ‘system’ (hey, we’ve all done it!) or worse yet the same password for everything then now is the time to upgrade to a Password Manager, that way if one website gets compromised you don’t risk your other accounts being hacked too.\n\n[1Password](https://1password.com) is pretty awesome and you can make this change gradually by moving your passwords into the manager as you login to services instead of all in one go. You’ll never have to try and remember which dumb rules a website expected for a password ever again.\n\n\n## Install a Firewall\nIt’s easy to forget about the desktop apps you use, they are all constantly phoning home too. [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html) will alert you every time an app tries to access the internet and let you set rules for access rather than letting everything out by default.\n\nI’ll be honest, it’s a real pain to use for the first few hours because rules need to be created for all your existing apps but the peace of mind may be worth it - did you know Spotlight makes requests to lots of different services for everything you type in there?\n\n\n## Use a VPN\nA VPN obscures your real IP address, and with it your location. It also creates an encrypted tunnel for all of your internet traffic that prevents your ISP from knowing and logging the websites that you visit.\n\nIf you have the technical skills and time I highly recommend setting up your own installation of OpenVPN - [here is a good tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu-16-04) for doing so on a DigitalOcean server that will run you $5/month. [TunnelBlick](https://tunnelblick.net/downloads.html) is a great well maintained, open source OpenVPN client for Mac.\n\n\n## Fin\nPhew! If you got this far then you are now considerably better off than you were at the start of this post.\n\nIs this foolproof? No, of course not - but with a little effort you’ve vastly reduced the amount of personally identifying information that is being gobbled up by companies about you with minimal affect on your everyday computer usage, nice!\n\n**Got any more suggestions for easy to implement privacy fixes? Let me know in the comments.**"},{"title":"Lessons learnt building team communication products","slug":"2015/09/21/lessons-learnt-building-team-products","date":"2015-09-21T18:00:00.000Z","tag":"","content":"\nAt [Speak](https://speak.io) we’ve been building team communication products for years, but when we began down this path I don’t think that any of us knew what was ahead. We all came from different backgrounds in gaming, b2c and ecommerce but we’d never tackled anything built for teams.\n\nWe’ve come to discover that creating a successful team product has it’s own set of unique challenges...\n\n\n## Multi platform\n\nUnlike one player consumer apps like games and photography tools, multi platform support is critical to the success of a team product. Whilst it’s easy to forget when living in the tech bubble, not everyone uses your OS of choice and most teams will have a mixture of operating systems in use. If your tool needs to be used by everyone then multi-platform is a must as soon as possible.\n\nIf you’re building for web then this means compatibility with all the major browsers, not just Chrome… and desktop apps need to embrace Windows with gusto!\n\n\n## Realtime is Hard\n\nIf you come from a background of building web experiences that rely on a page reload or short session times, moving to building real-time systems with millisecond race conditions and a client that users keep open for days or even weeks introduces a whole new set of fun challenges.\n\nAt [Speak](https://speak.io) we aim to connect audio in under a second. To achieve this, 50+ messages race through websockets and through our evented system which is built to withstand misordering, mistiming and lost messages altogether. Each layer of the system has to be built with fallbacks and proper error handling to ensure that when things go awry the user experience doesn’t end up suffering.\n\n\n## Activation is harder\n\nActivation is that ‘magic moment’ when you consider that a user has engaged with your product in a meaningful way. This may be sending an email, creating a post, uploading a file or in our case - having a quick audio call.\n\nThis is exponentially more difficult when you require multiple people to use your product synchronously to achieve it, so anything that can be done to give your team product a one-player experience will pay dividends as users will be more likely to keep the app open and actually still be online when their coworkers signup too...\n\n\n## Quality is Paramount\n\nEarly adopters playing around in their spare time are the most forgiving of users, they’re often amazingly keen to find and report bugs, put up with inconsistencies, fiddle with settings and love to be involved in helping with the product development process.\n\nEvery workplace has it’s early adopters for sure, but an entire team of them is an unlikely find! In order for your platform to be adopted in the workplace, beta quality just won’t do. A high level of polish and reliability is a must for the vast majority of teams to adopt and stick with your app.\n\n\n## Preferences are great\n\nWith our last product we were prone to thinking that if you design something well then options aren’t needed. In hindsight, this was a little naive, and when Slack came around this cemented that fact as the app was lauded for its customizability - not complexity.\n\nYou can almost think of a team as one user with multiple personalities, one minute they want a preference for this, and then a setting for the opposite, plus an admin control for everything. If you don’t satisfy all of the personalities at once then slowly the team will stop using the product. Clear and well organised preferences and options are the right solution!\n\n\n## Business != Boring\n\nThe trend of employees bringing consumer apps into business isn’t going away and the line between personal life and work continues to blur for creative professionals. Everyone would prefer to have a little fun whilst they work and one way to inject this into your day is to use tools with personality, animation and excitement!\n\n\n**The bar for a great business tool is continuously being raised and we’re excited to be tackling these challenges! Building something for teams yourself? I’d love to hear any thoughts you have on this subject in the comments…**"},{"title":"The Rollercoaster","slug":"2015/05/24/the-rollercoaster","date":"2015-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","tag":"","content":"\nLast week we launched [Speak](http://speak.io) on ProductHunt, there were a few days packed full of energy - many comments of [positivity](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/speak) and praise on the design, hundreds of teams signed up, lots of issues were reported (and quickly [fixed](https://github.com/speak/issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)), our servers were even briefly overloaded with traffic!\n\nAlmost two weeks later and we’re now experiencing the quiet after the storm. Every day has had a different vibe (at least, in my head) and my mood is vastly affected on an hourly basis by the feedback we receive and metrics we track… it’s hard to keep an even keel. As is often the case, [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/really.html) puts it best:\n\n\u003e \"In a startup, things seem great one moment and hopeless the next. And by next, I mean a couple hours later.”\n\n\nPersonally I think this is one of the most difficult times in a startups formative stages, and it's easy to lose heart. You have a few users, not enough to get excited, some retention, but not enough to be ecstatic, and requests pulling you in every direction from those that did signup and want you to solve their very specific problems.\n\nDan Shipper found the [perfect analogy](http://pando.com/2013/06/19/why-youre-on-a-startup-roller-coaster/) in that of a stock trader - if you constantly check how your stocks are performing then there is just as much chance of them being down as up, even if the longterm pattern is one of positivity and growth.\n\nAn acute awareness of this is the biggest step to dealing with it. Talk to customers, track and celebrate the small wins and keep plugging away at building something great!"},{"title":"Don't Grow Too Fast","slug":"2015/01/17/dont-grow-too-fast","date":"2015-01-17T18:00:00.000Z","tag":"","content":"\nDo you remember being told as a child that your eyes were bigger than your belly? Perhaps you were piling far too much food on your plate at dinner...\n\nAs a kid I always wanted to eat too much, grow up faster, be taller. I’d look up to those in years above at school and think how much older they seemed and that I couldn’t wait to be their age with all the benefits that it would bring… I think most of us thought something along these lines, right?!\n\nOf course now we realise how important those years are - there is no way we could simply skip to final exams without all of the learning and growth that these earlier days provide. I’ve found that in building startups, the very same temptations exist. The desire to be bigger than your boots, to grow too fast and to try and emulate those that are more grown up.\n\nAt [Sqwiggle](https://www.sqwiggle.com) we made this classic mistake too, jumping into hiring as soon as we’d raised our [seed round](/2013/09/06/lessons-learnt-raising-a-million-dollar-seed-round/) because that’s what you do. But really we were still in this early period of pre product market fit - we should have still been testing, experimenting and iterating towards great traction and zero churn. In hindsight an early burst of signups coupled with a successful funding round had confused us into thinking that we already had product market fit and our ambitions meant we were only too eager to grow up to the \"next stage\".\n\nStep back, embrace where you are at, don't grow too fast.\n\n\n**Update:** Brad Feld just published a post, \"[The Illusion of Product Market Fit](http://www.feld.com/archives/2015/01/illusion-product-market-fit-saas-companies.html)\" which sums up the above far better than I have."},{"title":"A Year In Review","slug":"2015/01/10/year-in-review","date":"2015-01-11T01:00:00.000Z","tag":"","content":"\n![IWNA Beijing Tour](/images/baidu.jpg)\n\nWriting is always the first thing that gives, whether we’re having a bumper month or a ton of trouble with our architecture and product - it seems as though there is always an excuse not to write about it...\n\nThis was definitely the case last year, where I published a grand total of _zero_ posts.

In fact, a lot went on...\n\n\n## Sqwiggle\nThis deserves (and will get) a post or two for itself, needless to say it was a year far from smooth sailing and chock full of events.\n\nI feel as though we experienced the entire startup lifecycle several times over from the post-raising hiring spree, a traction plateau and a trip through the infamous ‘valley of death’... much more to come on this.\n\n\n## Personal\nOn a personal level, 2014 was my most travelled year so far, and almost none of it planned more than a month in advance. It's fantastic having our company set up in a way that makes this possible...\n\n- January - Starting the year with a week in **New York**\n- February - **Lake Tahoe** for our first [company retreat](http://blog.sqwiggle.com/lessons-learned-first-company-retreat/)\n- March - My first SXSW experience in Austin, **Texas**\n- April - Two weeks in **Berlin** checking out the scene\n- May - Back to **England** for two weeks sorting out visa\n- June - Moved back to **San Francisco**\n- September - Two weeks in **[Beijing](https://medium.com/@kinwong/introducing-the-china-trek-for-founders-6a5f13ea2d3)** and **Hong Kong**\n- November - Exploring **Los Angeles** for a quick break\n- December - A long weekend in **Seoul** for a speaking slot and christmas in **England**\n\nAt the beginning of summer I finally regained my H1B visa and moved back to San Francisco on a more permanent basis, found a room, bought some furniture and a [bike](http://instagram.com/p/rDO9jDpHUY).\n\nIt’s nice to have somewhere to call home for the first time in 3 years."},{"title":"The Trouble with Timezones","slug":"2013/11/18/the-trouble-with-timezones","date":"2013-11-18T17:00:00.000Z","tag":"","content":"\n![The World](/images/timezones-globe.jpg)\n\nIt is often perceived that the challenges in building a distributed team lie in communication over distance, however with todays incredible technology and tools the problem is really one of communication across timezones. At Sqwiggle we are currently spread across 4 timezones and it is this rather than distance that creates problems like confusion over meeting times, not enough crossover time for discussions, odd working hours and more. These are just a few of the tricks and thoughts that I've had on the topic:\n\n\n## Keep communications in one timezone\nIn emails and spoken conversations try and pick one timezone and stick to it in all of your communications. This small hack makes a huge difference in stopping confusion, and you'll always know which timezone you arranged your meeting in. Of course which timezone you pick is upto you, it could be where you are based, where most of your clients are or where your company is, just be consistent.\n\n## Use a shared calendar\nA shared calendar such as Google Calendar provides a whole bunch of benefits, for a start each participant sees the event in their own timezone and in relation to their own day - a huge confusion buster. A shared calendar also has the advantage of increasing transparency within the company\n\n## Don't spread your team too thin\nWhen we began advertising our [open positions](http://angel.co/sqwiggle/jobs) we received a lot of applications from all over the world thanks to our \"you must remote work\" policy! This was great but we soon realised that at our size and stage of the company we would have to filter out many applications purely based on location so that we could reduce our timezone-spread.\n\n## Split your day in two\nRight now we are beginning to deal with the [maker / manager transition](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) at Sqwiggle. In my experience so far, being based in Europe with over half our team in the US affords a distinctive split in the day where the morning is quiet and great for focus on coding tasks whilst the afternoon becomes planning, discussion and other non-maker duties.\n\n## Something's gotta give\nEven taking these thoughts into account I've found that when working closely with a geographically diverse team the best thing you can do is increase the amount of crossover that you have for syncronous communication. This generally means one or both parties shifting working hours to accommodate more time spent working together. [Sqwiggle](https://www.sqwiggle.com) has proven very useful in this respect and I often stay logged in until late into the evening making me available for anyone on the team to ask quick questions that come up during their day.\n\n**Do you have any tips for working more effectively between timezones? Let me know in the comments, I'd love to give them a try**\n\n\u003cp class=\"caption\"\u003ePhoto by \u003ca href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/9828543@N05/5334352031\"\u003eStephen Ritchie\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"},{"title":"Commuting, Inefficiency and Working From The Beach","slug":"2013/10/29/commuting-inefficiency-working-from-beach","date":"2013-10-29T17:00:00.000Z","tag":"","content":"\n![Commuting](/images/commuting.jpg)\n\nThis weeks [Startup Edition](bit.ly/1eFpetV) asks the brilliant, open-ended question \"why are you working on your startup?\". It's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day of building a new company I thought this would be a great chance to pause and reflect, what brought me here and why is this so important?\n\nThe startup I'm working on is called [Sqwiggle](https://www.sqwiggle.com), we've taken to calling it your office in the cloud - a place where remote and distributed teams can feel as connected and together as a real world office.\n\n[Connecting the dots](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html) backwards it is easy for me to see a pattern of factors in my life that have led up to building this company and mission.\n\nI've always been drawn to the idea of working without a fixed location and being tied to a desk was one of the reasons that I left my previous career in architecture. Once we really took the plunge at [Buffer](http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/20/sharing-scheduler-app-buffer-raises-400000-gets-kicked-out-of-us/) by moving to Hong Kong, I knew that this was a way I could enjoy working for a long time (although, fixing bugs from the beach can be both awesome and a burden!).\n\nOne of my character traits is a sensitivity to inefficiency - I take shortcuts, jaywalk, multitask, answer emails whilst... well, doing anything and do my upmost to get as much productivity as possible out of every moment! One of the biggest and most frustrating examples of inefficiencies in the world is the life of a typical knowledge worker.\n\nThey sleep at home, have breakfast, catch a moment with the kids(?) and then head out the door - commute to work, sometimes taking an hour [or more](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_National_Highway_110_traffic_jam) and sit for 8 hours in a drab, uninspiring office building in front of a computer that's probably slower and older than the one they have at home. Then they travel home in the same traffic, catch a moment with the kids before they sleep and repeat. This system wastes untold amounts of energy and time in an age when we're desperately short on both.\n\nTo me this is one of the biggest opportunities for revolution in business today. The technology is there, but the tools and attitudes to working remotely have not caught up. I have a passion for building things that make peoples lives better and what better way to do that than improving the way they work?\n\nLast week we had the greatest email from one of our customers. They said they were considering moving house to a different town that they would enjoy more now they were using [Sqwiggle](https://www.sqwiggle.com) at their company.\n\n**Notes like this are why I can't wait to wake up and work on Sqwiggle every day.**\n\n\u003cp class=\"caption\"\u003ePhoto by \u003ca href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ashleycampbellphotography/\"\u003eAshley Campbell\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"},{"title":"Lessons Learnt Raising Our Million Dollar Seed Round","slug":"2013/09/06/lessons-learnt-raising-a-million-dollar-seed-round","date":"2013-09-07T06:06:00.000Z","tag":"","content":"\n\u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/san-francisco.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco\" style=\"width: 648px;\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nOver the last two months I've had the incredible privilege of being in San Francisco putting together a seed round for [Sqwiggle](https://www.sqwiggle.com) with my co-founders, [Matt](https://twitter.com/mattboyd) and [Eric](https://twitter.com/ericbieller). Incase you haven't come across it, Sqwiggle is a tool for distributed and remote teams to communicate better - we want to make remote working truly great.\n\nLooking back, I can't even really remember the moment that we decided to raise funding. We kicked around the idea since day one and had discussed on many occasions. In the end, we came to a consensus: with a little more money we could grow much faster and it would really help with the larger technical hurdles we were facing. Within a day I had a flight booked to the U.S. and began reaching out to potential investors and contacts.  \n\nIt's been crazy and exciting - for all of us this was the first time we had been actively involved in raising funding. We had so much to learn! Here are some of the unexpected lessons learned:\n\n## Find Your Ambassador\nIf I had one key takeaway it would be to find a single, well-connected person that can be your ambassador and help you get meetings with other investors through solid intros.\n\nIn our case this person turned out to be [Naval](https://angel.co/naval). My co-founder, Matt, reached out through a cold email and not only did he reply (amazing in itself!), but in what was definitely a turning point he also invited us down to the office, immediately understood the value of Sqwiggle and decided to invest almost immediately.\n\n## Selling the Product\nOver a couple of evenings I read Derek Sivers' book \"[Anything You Want](https://sivers.org/a)\". One quote stuck out to me - when you have a great product \"all doors will open\". He found that a lot of previous ideas were like pushing a rock up a hill, but with CDBaby everything just seemed to be so much easier.\n\nI definitely felt this on several occasions, where we stayed fairly quiet and potential investors started considering Sqwiggle, the many uses, expansion, enterprise possibilities and before I knew it they were onboard. Sometimes the right idea at the right time really can sell itself.\n\n## The Founder Story\nOne piece of feedback we got often is that at the seed stage it's all about the founder story, so make sure it's compelling. At [Sqwiggle](https://www.sqwiggle.com) our experiences of remote working came from many different angles and this helped us build a compelling narrative on how we all came across the problem separately and came together to fix it.\n\nEvery company has a story behind how and why it was formed, how you came together and your experience in the vertical. It's important to figure out yours and make sure that you're just as good at selling yourselves as the product.\n\n## Everything Stops\nI heard this statement many times before we started fundraising but didn't realize how true it really was. Once you pack your schedule with intros and meetings, there isn't time for anything else. The small amount of downtime is often consumed mentally and physically recovering.\n\n## AngelList\nThere is no denying, trending on [AngelList](https://angel.co) really is a golden ticket! I won't go into how to achieve this, mainly because I don't have a clue - but also because others have [already done it better](http://blog.justinthiele.com/trending-on-angellist-tactics-results/). We were trending for around two weeks and during that time had 55 intros and many offers to invest online through the platform. I can't even begin to stress how valuable this turned out to be.\n\n## VC's Aren't What I Thought\nThere are many different types of people that work for Venture Capital firms and they can't all be tarred with the same brush. Some partners come with decades of experience, others are serial entrepreneurs and each takes a different angle and will offer completely different value to your company.\n\nI went into the process with a skewed negative view of VC's (possibly from startup blogs?) but came out with four Venture Capital firms as investors.\n\n## Metrics and Numbers\nBe careful and consistent with numbers that you decide to give out. In general, don't be afraid to say that you don't know a particular figure (this isn't Shark Tank). We put together a pack of metrics updated once a week or so that we would send to investors when they asked. Regardless, most investors are more focused on the team and core idea rather than fine-grained metrics at seed stage.\n\n## Beer and Wine\nAfter meeting with a potential investor that we all agreed we didn't get the right vibe from we settled on the rough idea of a \"beer rule\". Which essentially meant that the person had to feel like someone we could grab a beer with, perhaps to lay down the current company problems and brainstorm ideas. Not everyone falls into this category - and I found it a great way to filter out those that didn't fit with our vision.\n\n## Keep Fuelled\nOn an average week whilst we were fundraising I walked over 115,000 steps (or 48miles!) according to FitBit. I also ended up skipping meals, but this definitely isn't advisable - if a hearty breakfast was ever appropriate, this is the time. [GetAround](http://getaround.com) also proved to be a saviour for many last minute trips to Palo Alto because you just can't walk everywhere!\n\n**Did you recently raise funding? I'd love to hear your story or how your experience differed in the comments.**"},{"title":"Pricing That Scales","slug":"2013/06/25/pricing-that-scales","date":"2013-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","tag":"","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eWe recently started charging companies to use \u003ca href=\"https://www.sqwiggle.com\"\u003eSqwiggle\u003c/a\u003e after only a month in private beta. We definitely don\u0026#8217;t have all of the functionality that customers asked for, there are still bugs and the price is high enough to put-off some companies from using the service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt first glance this might seem like a terrible idea, but being clear about our pricing and business model from day one has helped to both differentiate Sqwiggle from other perceived competitors and proved that companies are willing to pay to solve the problem we\u0026#8217;ve identified - a crucial part of validating the business idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSaaS Kicks Ass\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe best pricing strategy balances the needs of your startup and customer perfectly. I believe this is the reason that \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service\"\u003eSaaS\u003c/a\u003e has become an increasingly popular pricing choice. Our current model is to charge monthly, per user with a two week free trial. Every factor that makes this a great choice for Sqwiggle also works as an advantage for the customer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, we plan on running servers for hosting video calls with many participants through Sqwiggle. For an app that becomes part of a teams workflow being used all day, every day, the cost of this soon becomes significant. By charging per-user, as the amount of video bandwidth increases, so does our income.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the flipside, charging per-user allows the cost of using Sqwiggle to grow with the size of your business. If you\u0026#8217;re paying an employee thousands of dollars in wages per month then a couple of cents per day to make them more efficient and happy is a no-brainer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also a ton of other advantages that have been covered many times; predictable recurring revenue is the lifeblood of a SaaS business allowing us to plan expansion, costs and hiring. A trial with zero upfront payment means that employees can champion Sqwiggle internally and see the benefits without needing to ask higher management for approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Price Point\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s very early days and we\u0026#8217;re still experimenting with the optimum price to charge per user. At the moment we have a single price of \u003cstrong\u003e$9 per user, per month\u003c/strong\u003e.

After all, nothing creates a poor product quicker than simply adding everything your users ask for! The great entrepreneurs of our time excel at the craftsmanship of distilling and filtering ideas down to their fundamental principles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, Elon Musk regularly talks about his philosophy of reasoning from first principles rather than by analogy (check out \u003ca href=\"http://foundation.bz/20/\"\u003ethis great interview\u003c/a\u003e with Kevin Rose). The same principle applies with product feedback. Users will often make many assumptions with their suggested solutions, the key is to figure out the core problem and think from the ground up how to tackle it within the bounds of your product vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, with \u003ca href=\"https://www.sqwiggle.com\"\u003eSqwiggle\u003c/a\u003e we rethought video communication in this way - and realised that for our use-case the traditional \u0026#8216;call and answer\u0026#8217; model that other software uses just didn\u0026#8217;t make sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn my mind these steps are a great start. It would be great to know your processes for finding out what your users \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e want - i\u0026#8217;d love to know in the comments.

An email list, forums or customer support software like \u003ca href=\"https://getsatisfaction.com/\"\u003eGet Satisfaction\u003c/a\u003e / \u003ca href=\"http://uservoice.com\"\u003eUserVoice\u003c/a\u003e are popular ways to gather feedback\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt \u003ca href=\"http://bufferapp.com\"\u003eBuffer\u003c/a\u003e we found ourselves wondering if there was a better way, where the whole team could have a proper conversation with users and gather feedback incredibly fast as we rolled out new features and changes every few days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe decided to do something a little different and use \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/about/groups/\"\u003eFacebook groups\u003c/a\u003e.

In the last few years this has become easier than ever - with the advent of OAuth solutions such as Facebook Connect and Twitter Sign In users often no longer need to enter any details at all to sign up for your service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis got us thinking could we completely remove the barrier of signing up all together? \u003cstrong\u003eCould we make the account creation experience so easy that you might not even notice it had happened?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Approach\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there are some intricacies to handling a combined signup / signin on the server the first step is authorising the user with their social network of choice - and of course the UI is simpler than ever. We decided on a familiar \u0026#8216;stack\u0026#8217; of social networking buttons that can be consistently reproduced in all of the different sign in locations we have (web, browser extension, mobile).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m99djgKIaH1qz7mjl.png\" alt=\"Mobile sign in options\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp class=\"caption\"\u003eOur sign in screen, as seen on mobile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the web app the stack sits on the right hand side of our homepage and acts as a bright, strong call to action to. As more networks are added in the future we will likely add a \u0026#8220;more options\u0026#8221; button combined with a memory of the users last sign in choice which will always be displayed at the top of the stack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eChoosing the wording \u0026#8216;Sign In\u0026#8217; on the buttons rather than \u0026#8216;connect\u0026#8217; or other alternative wording hopefully gives the subtle impression that even new users already have an account and they just need to sign in to access it. The key is with \u0026#8216;Sign In\u0026#8217; you don\u0026#8217;t expect to have to do any more work, which makes the hurdle smaller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eKey Lessons\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eUsers are often looking for the words \u0026#8220;sign in\u0026#8221;, \u0026#8220;sign up\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;log in\u0026#8221;\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven (or perhaps especially) with a combined signup / sign in it is important to make it very clear that the user can do both actions with the same buttons. We included a friendly note on every entry point to get this message across\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m997xob0rW1qz7mjl.png\" alt=\"Friendly Note\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp class=\"caption\"\u003eLet people know that they can do both actions in the same place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMany people forget which social network they used previously\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one of the biggest problems we had after rolling out the changes, many users were forgetting which social network they had used to login and were creating two, three and even more accounts. Obviously this is a terrible user experience and it can also completely skew your metrics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe dealt with this situation in a couple of ways; by storing a separate long-life cookie whenever a user signs in we can check on signup if a user has been to Buffer before - we catch people that try to sign up with the cookie and display a screen like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m997vegLV41qz7mjl.png\" alt=\"Continue Screen\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp class=\"caption\"\u003eDetect and give users the option to sign in again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInevitably some users still fall through the cracks, perhaps because they clear their cookies or simply click on \u0026#8216;create account\u0026#8217; anyway. In these cases we need to let them merge their accounts together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Buffer we allow users to connect additional social media accounts on the dashboard, when the feature was first launched connecting an account already in the system would throw an error with a message to contact support - this would affect anyone who had accidentally created two accounts! As you can imagine, merging accounts quickly became one of our biggest support requests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully we have now completely removed this friction point also, as authorising with the social network is proof of ownership connecting an account that is already in the database simply merges the two together, seamlessly in the background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat about their email?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe disadvantage of users signing up with a social network is that you can\u0026#8217;t always get their email address and other details that may be important for your business. At Buffer we use the email to send alerts if there are any problems or if your Buffer becomes empty as well as optional newsletters and lifecycle triggered retention emails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m99bkhb7bn1qz7mjl.png\" alt=\"Email Banner\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp class=\"caption\"\u003eThe passive email banner\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRather than immediately hassle the user after signing in with a social network (that kind of defeats the point, doesn\u0026#8217;t it?) We opted to display a more passive banner at the top the dashboard which lets the user know \u003cstrong\u003ethe reason\u003c/strong\u003e we would like to have their email address, this works well and only displays after a welcome tour which means the user is much more invested in the product than they would have been if asked on a signup page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, does it matter? I would say that with the right measures in place to catch and automatically repair duplicate accounts it doesn\u0026#8217;t matter at all and in fact reducing complexity of the sign up process is well worth these measures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is now very rare that we get any of the support issues above and because the nature of Buffer is managing and connecting many social accounts we were probably more inclined to get these types of problems than many apps would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHave you implemented social sign in differently or had interesting problems with it in the past?

By spending a small amount of time identifying and setting up alerts for key metrics you can give yourself a powerful weapon that can be used to minimise problems and wow customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt \u003ca href=\"https://bufferapp.com\"\u003eBuffer\u003c/a\u003e we started with the very basics, using pingdom to send a text message if the website became unavailable - this works great for an MVP. Over the past year as the service has grown we have gradually built up and expanded the notifications to cover many more areas of the architecture and business to make sure we always know what is going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn my mind notifications are best split into two categories - active and passive. Active notifications are pushed through to email, sms or mobile apps and are used for emergencies or critical problems with the service. Passive notifications are displayed in our internal admin area, team chat or are sent in daily summary emails, these are things that we would ideally action but aren\u0026#8217;t immediate emergencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe key notifications that we are using today include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eActive Alerts\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eMacro business metrics\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith deploying code many times a day there is alway a chance that bugs will slip through unnoticed. It\u0026#8217;s important that if this happens they are detected as fast as possible and don\u0026#8217;t affect the things that really matter. We track the core metrics that are most important to our business every minute to ensure they are within preset acceptable bounds. Obviously these will be different for every business, for Buffer these are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpdates Sent\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAPI requests\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSignups\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUpgrades\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf any one of these metrics steps outside of pre-defined bounds then we are immediately notified via push alerts and email, for example if for two consecutive minutes no updates are sent then there is clearly a problem somewhere in the chain that needs immediate attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eBrand sentiment\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInspired by \u003ca href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/04/exclusive-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-facebook-release-engineering/1/\"\u003ean interview with Chuck Rossi\u003c/a\u003e of Facebook\u0026#8217;s release engineering team we also track sentiment (currently only on Twitter) for people mentioning @\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/bufferapp\"\u003ebufferapp\u003c/a\u003e. If there is a spike in negative tweets we are immediately notified that something may be wrong.

We use \u003ca href=\"http://www.serverdensity.com\"\u003eServer Density\u003c/a\u003e to perform minutely checks on all of our public facing services including the website, embeddable buttons and API. These are done in a round-robin fashion from multiple data centres around the world which means a more accurate average response time reading and ensures we are accessible from different regions of the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003ePassive Alerts\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eUpgrades and downgrades\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe display a list of the days upgrades and downgrades in the admin area which is visible to everyone on the team. We often reach out individually to users to thank them or in the case of a downgrade to try and trigger a discussion on why they left us and what we might have done differently to keep them..\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eInfluencer signups\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eObviously we would love to send a personal email to every new signup, but with this not being possible we thought it would still be nice to get in personal contact with influencers that signup for the service. At first this was an active notification, we setup the signup system so that \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/joelgascoigne\"\u003eJoel\u003c/a\u003e would receive an individual email every time a user with a large number of followers signed up. This quickly became a burden and the emails we\u0026#8217;re auto archived even after the trigger for an influencer was raised time and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn hindsight it is now obvious that this should have been a passive alert and in a similar fashion to upgrades we now display a list in the admin area of the days influencers and regularly get in contact with users to welcome them personally - this really helps to create the \u003ca href=\"http://www.desk.com/blog/touchpoint-opportunity-customer-wow/\"\u003ecustomer service wow factor\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eBrand mentions\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLike many businesses and individuals we use \u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com/alerts\"\u003eGoogle Alerts\u003c/a\u003e to inform us in a daily summary where Buffer is being talked about on the web. This lets us find posts that mention the service both in negative and positive ways. Often \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/LeoWid\"\u003eLeo\u003c/a\u003e can jump into the comments to directly answer questions and provide support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eCommits and deployments\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the past few months we have used \u003ca href=\"http://www.hipchat.com\"\u003eHipChat\u003c/a\u003e as the hub of day to day conversation at Buffer. In general HipChat has worked wonders at keeping the team motivated and upto date on what everyone else is working on. As part of this we push passive deployment and commit notifications into HipChat from Github, usually no action is required by anyone but this helps to keep the sense that other people are working and everything is always moving forward fast!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI hope some of these examples inspire you to think about how having more notifications and information at your disposal could give your startup an edge!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat have I missed?

In this time we have grown from a single Linode VPS shared with Joel's previous startup to a heady total of 10 VPS's and in the last week we undertook the biggest jump so far, moving our infrastructure from this cluster to \u003ca href=\"https://aws.amazon.com\"\u003eAmazon Web Services\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur approach to scaling has always been based on necessity - with the \u003ca href=\"http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/09/lean-startup.html\"\u003eLean Startup\u003c/a\u003e methodology ingrained into the company culture we push code fast and try to avoid prematurely scaling our infrastructure beyond it\u0026#8217;s needs. This has definitely lead to some sleepless nights and the occasional hour of downtime but all in all we feel this approach is much better than over compensating from the beginning and building architecture that you may never need or use. These are a few of the key occasions when scaling became the only option\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e1 Server: Launch to 20,000 users\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first version of Buffer was (\u003ca href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/idea-to-paying-customers-in-7-weeks-how-we-did-it\"\u003eperhaps famously\u003c/a\u003e) the embodiment of an MVP, a single pricing page that gauged potential interest in the idea before anything was even built. This was hosted on a tiny Linode VPS, shared with several other projects. Once the idea was validated and for the next year Joel was able to scale Buffer to 20,000 users by increasing the size of the VPS and optimising SQL queries, this meant a few hours of downtime each time the server was resized but allowed costs and time investment to remain low while product market fit was reached, or in Joel\u0026#8217;s words:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eFocus on \u0026#8220;scaling\u0026#8221; too early and you may well forget to focus on \u0026#8220;building something people want\u0026#8221;.

Over the course of several weeks the model layer was rewritten and the data migrated table by table from MySQL to collections in the document-based datastore \u003ca href=\"http://mongodb.org\"\u003eMongoDB\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the switchover, the new database was kept on the existing server, taking the place of MySQL. This worked well for around a month until early one Sunday morning Buffer suddenly disappeared from the internet. After tailing the error logs we quickly realised that we had reached an inherent limitation of MongoDB - 32-bit processes are limited to ~2gb of data and we had hit that limit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe searched frantically for a way to get the database back in action on the existing hardware. After half an hour with no luck and \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/leowid\"\u003eLeo\u003c/a\u003e calming distressed users on twitter we realised we had to get in touch with the best person we knew. We called \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/elubow\"\u003eEric Lubow\u003c/a\u003e from \u003ca href=\"http://simplereach.com\"\u003eSimpleReach\u003c/a\u003e who put us on the right path in minutes - there was no other option but to accept the downtime and spin up another 64-bit server immediately. Thanks to clear, straight forward advice we got off very lightly with less than two hours of disruption in a quiet period as we setup a server, tarballed the existing data directory and shuttled it across!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e4 Servers: Background Processes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy November 2011, Buffer had continued to grow to around 70,000 users and with 20,000 tweets per day being sent the website and browser extension were becoming noticeably slower at the peak time of the day (for us this is around 17:00 GMT, early evening in the UK and morning on the East Coast). At this point it was time to queue the sending tasks and have them processed by their own dedicated server. In hindsight this was the turning point where a Buffer \u0026#8216;architecture\u0026#8217; started to emerge, with modular pieces of code and servers that we\u0026#8217;re independent of each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the core task of sending tweets was moved to queues it became obvious that a lot of other processing could be completed this way such as gathering link info, analytics and image processing. We went ahead and moved these tasks to two new utility servers, I\u0026#8217;ll be covering the details behind how we now use queues extensively at Buffer in a future post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e5 Servers: Upgrading MongoDB\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn December our database server was humming along nicely but quickly filling up it\u0026#8217;s available RAM headroom and running on an out of date version of MongoDB. In order to upgrade the software and the server to more RAM (as we would end up doing several times of the next few months) we needed to be in a replica set configuration that would allow us to take the individual database servers out of circulation one by one to upgrade them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis proved to be another rocky period with several hours of downtime, we found this was almost entirely caused by issues in the immature PHP drivers which have since been addressed but also partly down to our own lack of experience managing replica sets, firewalls and all of the intricacies of a multi-server setup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e7 Servers: DiggDigg Acquisition\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn January of this year we hit the 100,000 user milestone and completed our acquisition of the popular WordPress plugin \u003ca href=\"http://bufferapp.com/diggdigg\"\u003eDiggDigg\u003c/a\u003e which allows any WordPress user to quickly add a sharing bar to their blog or website. Part of the plan behind this move was to add the \u003ca href=\"http://bufferapp.com/extras/button\"\u003eBuffer Button\u003c/a\u003e to DiggDigg and have it enabled by default for new installations, adding massively to the button\u0026#8217;s reach and Buffer branding around the web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to handle the millions of new button impressions and isolate the web interface from load generated by third party websites it was time to move the button to it\u0026#8217;s own servers and introduce our first load balancer. It was also decided to use Nginx AND just for good measure re-write the entire button to become independent of the Buffer framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe definitely teetered on the edge of our seats after deploying all of this previously unused architecture at once, waiting for the load from DiggDigg to hit the servers. But everything went smoothly, the load balancer acted as expected and impressions gradually rose to new highs as people upgraded their plugin (it seems there is no sudden rush of traffic!). The button servers now handle around 4 million impressions per day and rising!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e9 Servers: Sleepless Nights\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLast month we reached 180,000 registered users and completed the acquisition of ShareFeed from \u003ca href=\"http://www.kissmetrics.com\"\u003eKISSmetrics\u003c/a\u003e. Almost unbelievably, at this time the main website, API, blog and browser extension were all still running from a single Linode VPS (albeit one that had been upgraded on many occasions!). During peak times things we\u0026#8217;re beginning to feel slow again and complaints started to appear on Twitter at predictable times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately late evening Hong Kong time (\u003ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/20/sharing-scheduler-app-buffer-raises-400000-gets-kicked-out-of-us\"\u003ewhere we are currently based\u003c/a\u003e) is the peak time for traffic at Buffer. For almost a week I had incredibly restless sleep, I became acutely aware of every email received, waking up at the slightest sound convinced that the site would be down. It was definitely time to upgrade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThanks to all we had learnt creating the new environment for the Buttons several months before, we were able to make this move completely seamlessly. By setting up the load balancer, adding the new servers and testing thoroughly before moving the DNS we were able to ensure that the only thing users noticed was a performance increase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eThats Not All Folks\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s been an amazing ride so far with both highs and some serious lows, at one point working for nearly 30 hours straight just to keep the site online. We have learnt an incredible amount as a team in the last few months and I can\u0026#8217;t think of any way we could have learnt more, faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLast week we migrated the whole of Buffer\u0026#8217;s architecture to Amazon Web Services with less than two hours of scheduled downtime, making a number of huge changes and improvements in the process.

Currently we use a combination of third party tools such as \u003ca href=\"http://kissmetrics.com\"\u003eKissmetrics\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics\"\u003eGoogle Analytics\u003c/a\u003e as well as our own hand-rolled metrics for internal data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe area where we are most happy with our approach is in measuring internal statistics, for example how many people used the latest Firefox extension last week, or how many API requests to which endpoints were there in the last 2 hours or which website with the Buffer widget provided the most signups last week?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo make informed product decisions we need to easily access and visualise key business data in realtime.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eUsing MongoDB to measure realtime stats\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur current tool of choice is \u003ca href=\"http://www.mongodb.org\"\u003eMongoDB\u003c/a\u003e, using a combination of \u003ca href=\"http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Atomic+Operations\"\u003eatomic \u0026#8216;inc\u0026#8217; methods\u003c/a\u003e and \u0026#8216;unsafe\u0026#8217; saves we can update key metrics in the database blindingly fast with a negligible affect on performance of the front end (as the driver doesn\u0026#8217;t wait for save success before continuing).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy storing these statistics in minutely, weekly or hourly batches we can also limit data growth to a predictable rate and increase read speeds in the admin area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\u003ccode class=\"javascript\"\u003e\n    db.clients_by_time.update({\n        'hour': $hour,\n        'client_id': $client_id\n    }, {\n        '$inc' =\u0026gt; array(\n            'requests' =\u0026gt; 1,\n            'statuses.'.$status_code =\u0026gt; 1,\n            'endpoints.'.$endpoint =\u0026gt; 1,\n            'response_time' =\u0026gt; round($response_time)\n        )\n    }, true);\n\u003c/code\u003e\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe code snippet above is inspired by \u003ca href=\"http://blog.mongodb.org/post/171353301/using-mongodb-for-real-time-analytics\"\u003ethis post\u003c/a\u003e on the mongodb blog and is used to record the performance usage of Buffer API clients. It allows us to produce detailed graphs like the following in realtime and with upto the second data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4qii3RgVa1qz7mjl.png\" alt=\"Buffer API graph\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp class=\"caption\"\u003eA typical API client\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral individual values are incremented, one for the total requests as well as individual status codes and endpoints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes tricks can be used to allow the use of incrementing values where you might not usually, for example in the above code \u0026#8216;response_time\u0026#8217; is incremented with the response time of each API request - the value becomes the sum total of all API requests in the hour. It is then easy to calculate the average when we return the document by dividing by the total requests. To store the average in the document itself would require an extra query for every request and this is well worth avoiding!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4rw5fQ6ad1qz7mjl.png\" alt=\"Buffer extensions graph\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp class=\"caption\"\u003eBuffer update sources\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eWhere to go from here\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe believe that this approach scales exceptionally well and it has certainly done us proud so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs the dataset grows it is inevitable that we will want to automate weekly, monthly and eventually yearly rollups and with only 168 documents created per collection, per week for data recorded hourly this is a task that can be easily performed in code rather than requiring map reduce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy far the biggest area for improvement is in our display of all the data we are gathering. At the moment this is largely using simple line graphs with raw values over time (we don\u0026#8217;t even have a way to go back to previous weeks yet!). Some of the analytics would also be much better expressed as percentages of a total, stacked graphs or one of the many other types of charts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHave any thoughts on our approach?
