I write as much for ‘future me’ as anyone else and I don’t want to look back on 2014 in a decades time and ask myself - “wait, what the hell happened that year?!”. In fact, a lot went on...\n\n\n## Sqwiggle\nThis deserves (and will get) a post or two for itself, needless to say it was a year far from smooth sailing and chock full of events.\n\nI feel as though we experienced the entire startup lifecycle several times over from the post-raising hiring spree, a traction plateau and a trip through the infamous ‘valley of death’... much more to come on this.\n\n\n## Personal\nOn a personal level, 2014 was my most travelled year so far, and almost none of it planned more than a month in advance. It's fantastic having our company set up in a way that makes this possible...\n\n- January - Starting the year with a week in **New York**\n- February - **Lake Tahoe** for our first [company retreat](http://blog.sqwiggle.com/lessons-learned-first-company-retreat/)\n- March - My first SXSW experience in Austin, **Texas**\n- April - Two weeks in **Berlin** checking out the scene\n- May - Back to **England** for two weeks sorting out visa\n- June - Moved back to **San Francisco**\n- September - Two weeks in **[Beijing](https://medium.com/@kinwong/introducing-the-china-trek-for-founders-6a5f13ea2d3)** and **Hong Kong**\n- November - Exploring **Los Angeles** for a quick break\n- December - A long weekend in **Seoul** for a speaking slot and christmas in **England**\n\nAt the beginning of summer I finally regained my H1B visa and moved back to San Francisco on a more permanent basis, found a room, bought some furniture and a [bike](http://instagram.com/p/rDO9jDpHUY).\n\nIt’s nice to have somewhere to call home for the first time in 3 years."},"__N_SSG":true}
