You might\nwonder why you would bother, after all it's not as though you're going to\nbe man-in-the-middled by a malicious actor on your local machine.\n\nOf course, the main reason is to ensure that your development environment\nbehaves as closely as possible to production. This is especially important\nwhen you're using a service worker, as they will only work over HTTPS.\n\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking that it's complicated to set up SSL certificates\nfor your development environment. `mkcert` allows you to create a local\ncertificate authority and generate SSL certificates for your development\nenvironment in a single line of codeâ€¦\n\n```\nmkcert -cert-file ./public.cert -key-file ./private.key \"*.outline.dev\"\nmkcert -install\n```\n\nSee this in action in the [outline/outline codebase](https://github.com/outline/outline/blob/main/server/scripts/install-local-ssl.js)."},"__N_SSG":true}
