[Outline](https://www.getoutline.com) recently reached 20,000 [GitHub stars](https://github.com/outline/outline/stargazers), so I wanted to take a moment to
thank everyone who has been involved in the project over the last few years and helped it reach this milestone.
Particularly those that have become paying customers and sponsors, or contributed code and translations.

What started as a side project is now one of the most popular repositories on GitHub, and is used by thousands of companies and teams
around the world to manage their documents.

It feels like there's a never ending list of things still to do, and I'm excited to continue building the product and a sustainable business.

See you at 50k stars!
