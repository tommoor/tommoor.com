I’ve decided to return to try a more regular blog cadence and record some of the thinking and process behind building [Outline](https://www.getoutline.com?ref=tommoor) (and hopefully other products!).

Because the [source code](https://www.github.com/outline/outline) of Outline is public and is one of only a few large Node applications with a fully open codebase I’m hoping it can allow for a unique lens into product development and engineering decisions that isn’t often shared!

One of the reasons I haven't posted in the last few years was the difficulty in doing so, the old site
was using Jekyll and the hassle of remembering how to publish was just enough friction to prevent it happening… So, in an effort to remove this hurdle I cloned the [outline-website](https://github.com/outline/website) repository, tore it apart, added in all the old markdown posts and ta-da – new site running on Next.js!
